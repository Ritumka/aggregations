# Advanced ActiveRecord Querying / Aggregations

Hey there! We're [thoughtbot](https://thoughtbot.com), a design and
development consultancy that brings your digital product ideas to life.
We also love to share what we learn.

This coding exercise comes from [Upcase](https://thoughtbot.com/upcase),
the online learning platform we run. It's part of the
[Advanced ActiveRecord Querying](https://thoughtbot.com/upcase/advanced-activerecord-querying) course and is just one small sample of all
the great material available on Upcase, so be sure to visit and check out the rest.

## Exercise Intro

In this exercise, you'll learn how to use aggregate functions to run calculations like finding the maximum value in a data set.

## Instructions

To start, you'll want to clone and run the setup script for the repo

    git clone git@github.com:thoughtbot-upcase-exercises/aggregations.git
    cd aggregations
    bin/setup

After cloning and running `bin/setup`:

* Review `db/schema.rb` to get a sense of the database schema you'll be querying.
* Take a look at the classes in `app/models` to get familiar with the models and associations you'll be working with.
* Edit `spec/models/person_spec.rb` and remove the `pending` line from the first spec.
* Edit `app/models/person.rb` and implement `maximum_salary_by_location` to get the spec passing.
* Edit `spec/models/person_spec.rb` and remove the other `pending` line.
* Edit `app/models/person.rb` again and implement `managers_by_salary_difference` to make the spec pass.

You can run `rake` to re-run the tests at any time.

Once all the tests are passing (and there are no pending specs), you're all set!
